## 🛠️ Development

These instructions will get you a copy of this project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 📋 Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. Get a copy of this repository
   - Either by clicking the `Use this template` button next to the `Clone or download` button and creating a new GitHub repository based on this template
   - Or by clicking the `Clone or download` button and then cloning or just simply downloading the repository
1. Start editing the repository contents
   - Either by opening up this `README.md` in your text editor - or, even better, open the whole folder into which you cloned or downloaded this repository
   - Or - if you're using a GitHub repository - by making the changes directly in the web interface, after you created your own repository based on this template
1. Rename the `LICENSE` file, so it's clear that is the license for this original repository and keep it in your repository
   - E.g. name it `LICENSE-template-vscode`
1. Add your own `LICENSE` file
1. Add your code and everything else, which is part of your project
1. Add recommended extensions to `.vscode/extensions.json` under `recommendations`
   - You need to enter the extension's ID, which you can find by selecting the extension in VSCode's Extension menu and then you'll see it next to the extension's name in the main window
1. Change the title (`#`) of this README according to your project name and choose a fitting emoji to add to it
1. Take a screenshot from your project in action and replace `docs/images/usage.png` with it
1. Edit the sections as you need
1. Add documentation and examples to `docs/`, if needed
   - Otherwise remove `docs/docs.md` and `docs/examples.md`, as well as the relevant sections
1. Remove other sections you don't need
1. Remove emojis from 3rd-level sections (`###`), if they are too close together (= not a lot of content in the sections) to avoid them getting too distracting
